# Fitness Manager 

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind creating this project stems from the desire to empower users in their fitness journeys and provide administrators with an efficient tool to support and monitor their progress effectively. We wanted to enhance the overall fitness experience and encourage individuals to stay on track with their fitness routines.

## What it does
Our project is an administrative tool designed to manage and organize data related to users' fitness regimes. It provides a comprehensive system for storing and tracking information, allowing administrators to effectively monitor and support users in their fitness journeys. The tool encompasses various database models, including users, workouts, exercises, training plans, fitness goals, achievements, physical measurements, and gym locations. With this tool, administrators can facilitate consistency and organization in users' workouts, enabling them to track progress, set personal targets, and achieve their fitness goals more effectively. A specific example of an application of our project is for personal trainers to log information associated with their clients. For example a personal trainer could use this app to track and update their clientsâ€™ measurements as their fitness progresses.  

## How we built it
HTML and CSS was used to develop the frontend interface. For the backend, we used PHP for server-side scripting, SQL for interacting with the Oracle Database, and the Oracle DBMS for storing and retrieving data.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge our team encountered was the unfamiliarity with working with PHP, SQL, and the Oracle DBMS. None of us had prior experience with these technologies, and it took some time to understand their nuances and how they interacted. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to successfully integrate the frontend with the backend and create a fully functional web application within a short timeframe of less than a week. Despite the initial challenges of working with PHP, SQL, and the Oracle DBMS for the first time, our team collaborated to understand and overcome any obstacles.

## What we learned 
We learned how to integrate a frontend and a backend, and work with PHP, SQL, and Oracle DBMS.
